# Lethal Company Modpack

I am not a creator, nor do I own any of these assets. This is meerly a collection of mods to share with friends in convinient manner.

To use this, just place it into game directory.

Sources to all of the files can be found in a script `.mods/update_mods.sh`.


##  Location

If you have installed Steam via Flatpak, then the path is:
```
~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Lethal Company/
```

The resulting directory structure should look something like this:
```
~/.var/.../Lethal Company/
├── .git/
├── .mods/
│   ├── old/
│   ├── update_mods.sh
│   ├── 2018-LC_API-3.4.5.zip
│   └── ...
├── BepInEx/
├── icon.png
├── Lethal Company_Data/
├── Lethal Company.exe
├── MonoBleedingEdge/
└── ...
```
